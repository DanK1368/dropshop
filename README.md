### The Problem: 
Over the years the internet has become a general marketplace for companies and individuals alike to 
sell their products. For many, however, managing their inventory online proves to be a challenge, 
including displaying of products to be sold immediately. 

### The Solution:
Our projects aims to solve this issue through a user-friendly and intuitive process.

A dashboard allows for the seller to create products and manage them through a Kanban-style interface.
Products can be dragged to different columns to display them online, or for a discount to be applied.
